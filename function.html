    <h3 id="constant">Constant</h3>
    <p>Constant is a symbol which retains the same value throughout a set of mathematical operation. <br>
        Constant are of two types, such as <br>
        (1) Absolute Constant: y = 3x + 7 <br>
        (2) Arbitrary Constant: y = mx + c
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3 id="variable">Variable</h3>
    <p>
        A variable is a quantity which is capable of taking various numerical values. <br>
Variables are of two types, such as: <br>
(1) Dependent Variable. <br>
(2) Independent Variable.
    </p>

    <h3 id="function">Function</h3>
    <p>
        If X and Y are two non-empty sets and f is such a rule that gives a unique y ∈ Y for each x ∈
X then f is called a function from to the set X to the set Y. It is denoted by f: X → Y.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3 id="domain">Domain</h3>
    <p>
        The domain of a function f is the set of all allowable input values. It’s also called the pre-
image set.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3 id="range">Range</h3>
    <p>
        The range of a function f is the set of all output values produced by f. It’s also called image
set.

    <h3 id="one-one">One-One/Injective Function</h3>
    <p>
        Let f: X → Y be a function. If distinct element of X has distinct
images in Y, then the function is called one-one or injective.

    <h3 id="onto">Onto/Surjective</h3>
    <p>
        Let f: A → B be a function. If all elements of set B are the
Images of the elements of A, then the function is called onto or surjective function.
    </p>

    <h3 id="into">into</h3>
    <p>Let f: A → B be a function. If there exists even a single element in B having
        no pre-image in A, then such function is called into function.
